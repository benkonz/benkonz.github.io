I am a data-engineer on the Forensiq-platform team at [Impact](https://impact.com). I've created software tooling to increase data reliability, written tests to verify the correctness of [AVRO IDL](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/idl.html) files, and enhanced the data enrichment suite.

## Projects
 
### Jeroo

Jeroo is a programming language learning tool designed for classroom use. I designed the compiler to handle multiple language styles, such as Python, Java, and Visual Basic. The compiler, written in OCaml, is also able to type-check and generate efficent bytecode. The bytecode is then interpreted, in TypeScript, as various actions on the Jeroo game board.

The game can be played here: [jeroo.org/beta](https://www.jeroo.org/beta)
