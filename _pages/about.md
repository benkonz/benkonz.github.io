I am a data-engineer on the
[Forensiq](https://impact.com/ad-fraud-detection/)-platform team at [Impact](https://impact.com). 
I've created software tooling to increase data reliability, written tests to
verify the correctness of [AVRO IDL](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/idl.html) files, 
and enhanced the data enrichment suite.

## Projects

### Jeroo

Jeroo is a programming language learning tool designed for classroom use. 
I designed the compiler to handle multiple language styles, such as Python, 
Java, and Visual Basic. The compiler, written in OCaml, is also able to 
type-check and generate efficent bytecode. The bytecode is then interpreted, 
in TypeScript, as various actions on the Jeroo game board.

The game can be played here: [jeroo.org/beta](https://www.jeroo.org/beta).

### Gameboy (Color) Emulator

My Gameboy Emulator project is a functional hardware emulator for the 1989
Nintendo Gameboy and Gameboy Color. It is capable of playing Gameboy ROM files such as
Tetris and Pokemon Crystal. The emulator is written entirely in Rust and is 
capable of beging compiled to various OS's and web browsers through Web Assembly.

Features include: multiple hardware types, accurate emulation (passes Blargg cpu_instrs tests),
Real Time Clock emulation, battery backup saving, and Gameboy Color emulation.

The source code can be found here: [benkonz/gameboy_emulator](https://github.com/benkonz/gameboy_emulator).

The web port is running here: [emulator](/assets/emulator)

### Bitset Container

My Bitset Container project is a C++ Header Only library that provides C++ STL
iterator functionality for bits of arbitrary length.

The source code can be found here: [benkonz/BitsetContainer](https://github.com/benkonz/BitsetContainer)
